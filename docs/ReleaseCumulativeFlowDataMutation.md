`func (o *ReleaseCumulativeFlowDataMutation) GetReleaseCumulativeFlowData() ReleaseCumulativeFlowDataMutationReleaseCumulativeFlowData`

GetReleaseCumulativeFlowData returns the ReleaseCumulativeFlowData field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetReleaseCumulativeFlowDataOk

`func (o *ReleaseCumulativeFlowDataMutation) GetReleaseCumulativeFlowDataOk() (*ReleaseCumulativeFlowDataMutationReleaseCumulativeFlowData, bool)`

GetReleaseCumulativeFlowDataOk returns a tuple with the ReleaseCumulativeFlowData field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetReleaseCumulativeFlowData

`func (o *ReleaseCumulativeFlowDataMutation) SetReleaseCumulativeFlowData(v ReleaseCumulativeFlowDataMutationReleaseCumulativeFlowData)`

SetReleaseCumulativeFlowData sets ReleaseCumulativeFlowData field to given value.

### HasReleaseCumulativeFlowData
